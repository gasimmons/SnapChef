[WIP]
Starting 8/17/24

The goal of this project is create an app that takes in a photo of a fridge for the start, want to extend to freezer, and pantries, using a cv model (undecided at the moment on which one) it will create a list of all the ingredients (Later take into account brands, macros, allergens) and it will return recipes that are possible using the ingredients. Also in the future one of the ideas I want to implement is that it will also return recipes in which you have most of the ingredients, giving ideas for grocery runs, (Possibly implement in app grocery list). Also want to explore meal prep options. 

The project as of now is just me, and will be implemented in swift as a way of developing my swift skills. For now, this project has no plans of monetization, but once I start getting user feedback, and if there is a general demand for this project I will consider it in the future, either through ads or paid features.
